# Throwing Birds

This is a score-keeping application for playing disc golf.

Disc golf can be played with different rules, so this webb-app features a page that generate rules that are popular amongst my friends. The design is intentionally made to be simple and clear as this app will be used on the go.

## Getting started

Install node and run `npm start`

## Limitations

The purpose of this project was to gain some repetition with React and Redux concepts. It is intended to be used on a mobile device so the styling is currently only optimised for mobiles.

This is a work in progress. Future improvements include:

- Connecting a backend, as there is currently no data persistence.
- Adding tests.
